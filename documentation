Project 1 - Documentation

--- Project Structure ---
The structure of this project is as follows:
- lib folder
- src folder
--- fileHandler.js
--- initializationHandler.js
--- keyPressHandler.js
--- renderHandler.js
- project2.html
- project2.js
- stylesheet.css

--- File Contents ---
The lib folder contains three JavaScript files which were given to us to use throughout programming in WebGL.
They were written to help make certain calculations and functions simpler.  I did not edit or change these files
in any way.

The project1.html file defines the UI of the webpage, while also defining the elements used throughout
the project.  Any element which contains an "id" field is used later in our JavaScript. The important
elements are the canvas, which I gave extra styling (a border) to aid in visualization, various text
based elements for all text displayed on the webpage, and two input elements.  The first input element
is used for letting users upload a .dat file.  The second is used to allow the user to choose a color
from a color palette to change the color of the image drawn.

The project2.js file contains the center point for handling all input events and initiating the
rendering of the program.

All of the files within the src folder are named appropriately for the function they serve.

Finally, the CSS file is mainly used for spacing so that I could make my webpage look the way I wanted
it to in a clean way that follows standard web development practices.
